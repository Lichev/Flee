# FleeProject

Welcome to **FleeProject** – the code may not be finished, but procrastination is always done to perfection! 🚀

### 🚧 Under Construction (AKA: I'll Finish It Later)

So, here's the deal: this project is still a **work in progress**. But don't worry, I'm 100% sure that future me will come back to finish it... eventually. 😅

In the meantime, feel free to browse around, make yourself at home, and if you see something missing or broken... well, that’s on **future me** to fix. 💻✨

### 🌱 Coming Soon... Probably

- [ ] Feature X: The one that everyone’s waiting for... including me.
- [ ] Feature Y: Trust me, it’s going to be *awesome* when I get around to it.
- [ ] Documentation: Who needs documentation when you have coffee? ☕
- [ ] A polished final version... Stay tuned! 🛠️

### 👀 Until Then...
If you catch me working on something else instead of finishing this... well, let’s just call it "prioritizing creativity." 🎨✨

Thanks for visiting! Don't forget to check back later – future me promises it’ll be worth it. 😉
